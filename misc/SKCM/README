The TCGA SKCM data required some preprocessing.

Downloaded files had patient level data and the resulting archives were too
large to all be decompressed at once.

processData.R was used to create input rna and mir data from downloaded files.
It also performed the first step of processing for the DNA methylation files,
resulting in 7 *compiled.txt files.
SKCM_methylation_merge.R was used to collapse these and average technical
replicates.
