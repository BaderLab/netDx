3.14 RELEASE 
==================

netDx 1.7.1
==================
* Added vignette showing how to view top features as connected networks in Cytoscape (Enrichment Map). 
* Improved Java support. Includes:
  * Prompt to users to install Java if not installed, and requirement check for Java 16 or lower.
  * Feature selection with Java 12+ resulted in an "illegal access" error due to a change in how Java handles reflection. netDx sidesteps
  the error for Java 9-16 but cannot do so for Java 17. Java 12-16 should now work with feature selection.
* plotPerf() now provides the option to not plot the ROC and PR curves with a drawPlot parameter.

netDx 1.5.10
==================
* Functions to create network visualizations of top-scoring functions renamed to better reflect function.
  * plotEMap() -> viewSelectedFeaturesAsNetworks 
  * makeInputForEnrichmentMap() -> createInputForFeatureNetworkView()

netDx 1.5.9
==================
* Ability to smooth somatic mutations over an interaction network via (smoothMutations_LabelProp) has been temporarily removed. This function made software install challenging on machines without C++ compilers as it relies on clusterExperiment. The latter can only be compiled from source. This functionality will be added back when doing so does not complicate the install. It is unclear whether users want to routinely use this functionality.

netDx 1.5.8
==================
* Moved RCy3, scater, clusterExperiment and netSmooth to "Suggests" to reduce dependency burden
* Sped up vignettes by limiting all to binary classification and limiting number of layers
* Removed TL;DR from vignettes as usefulness in question but maintainance high.

Developer notes:
-------------------
* Added Dockerfile and Github Actions for automated testing
* GHA auto-generates a Docker image with netDx which gets pushed to shraddhapai/netdx_devenv

netDx 1.5.2
==================
* Added wrapper functions for ease-of-use. Includes:
	* getResults() to plot results of running the predictor
	* getPSN() for creating and visualizing integrated PSN
	* confusionMatrix() to visualize confusion matrix
	* tSNEPlotter() to visualize tSNE of integrated PSN (doesn't require Cytoscape)
* Added CITATION file with citations to netDx methods and software paper

netDx 1.5.1
==================
* Adding support for Java 16. 
* Disabling CNV-based vignette to allow other three vignettes to run without causing build timeout on devel system

netDx 1.1.4
==================
Changes:
* New functionality to smooth mutations over interaction, starting from sparse
somatic mutations
* BiocFileCache usage update
